Risk module
1. Risk Registry & Identification
•	Risk Catalog: Create a centralized repository for all organizational risks
•	Risk Categories: Support standard frameworks (COSO, ISO 31000, NIST)
•	Risk Hierarchies: Enable parent-child relationships and risk groupings
•	Risk Templates: Pre-built risk scenarios for common business areas
•	Custom Risk Creation: Allow users to define organization-specific risks
2. Risk Assessment Engine
•	Qualitative Assessment: Likelihood × Impact matrices (3×3, 4×4, 5×5)
•	Quantitative Assessment: Monte Carlo simulations, VaR calculations
•	Multi-dimensional Scoring: Consider velocity, detectability, complexity
•	Inherent vs Residual Risk: Track risk levels before and after controls
•	Risk Appetite Integration: Color-coded indicators against defined thresholds
3. Risk Treatment & Controls
•	Control Library: Centralized repository of risk controls
•	Control Effectiveness: Track design and operational effectiveness
•	Treatment Strategies: Accept, Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate options
•	Action Plans: Remediation workflows with owners and deadlines
•	Control Testing: Schedule and track control assessments
4. Risk Monitoring & Reporting
•	Risk Dashboards: Executive and operational views
•	Heat Maps: Visual risk landscape representations
•	Trend Analysis: Risk evolution over time
•	Key Risk Indicators (KRIs): Automated monitoring and alerting
•	Regulatory Reporting: Pre-built templates for common frameworks
